128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Constraints:
0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
"""
# Time complexity: O(N)
# Space complexity: O(N)
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = set(nums)
        longest = 0
        while nums:
            first = last = nums.pop()
            while first - 1 in nums:
                first -= 1
                nums.remove(first)
            while last + 1 in nums:
                last += 1
                nums.remove(last)
            longest = max(longest, last-first+1)
        return longest
